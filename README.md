# Rotten Harvest

Rotten Harvest was a game made over 10 hours for [Ludum Dare 52](https://ldjam.com/), first time I have actually finished something for a game jam!

Art is from the [Tiny Farm Pak](https://vryell.itch.io/tiny-farm-pack) by Vryell.
Sounds from various [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/) packs.

Please forgive the absolute noodle code, to compile; simply install Raylib and run `'build.sh'`...
